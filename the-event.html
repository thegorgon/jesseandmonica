    <strong>The Ceremony</strong> will commence at 5:00pm in the courtyard of the Ebell. In an attempt to represent the 3 cultures Monica and Jesse were raised with, the ceremony will be a fusion of aspects of American, Jewish, and Persian wedding traditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The Reception</strong> will be hosted adjacent to the courtyard in the Ebell's dining room immediately following the ceremony. Dinner and drinks will be served with live music and vivacious dancing.
