    <strong>The Ceremony</strong> will commence at 5:00pm at the Ebell. In an attempt to represent the 3 cultures Monica and Jesse were raised with, the ceremony will be a fusion of aspects of American, Jewish, and Persian wedding traditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The Reception</strong> will be hosted at the Ebell immediately following the ceremony. Dinner and drinks will be served with live music and vivacious dancing.
  </p>

    <strong>The Ebell of Los Angeles</strong> is located at <a class='directions' target='_blank' href='{{ site.data.links.ebell_directions }}'>743 S. Lucerne Boulevard, Los Angeles, California</a>. The Ebell was constructed in 1927 to house the Ebell Women's Club and the renowned Wilshire Ebell Theatre. The building was declared a Cultural Historic Monument in 1982. Notable performances at the Ebell include Judy Garland's first audition and Amelia Aerhart's final public appearance before her around-the-world flight.
