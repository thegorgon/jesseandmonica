  <h1 class='center'>Registry</h1>
  <p class='center'>While unnecessary, it's customary for guests at a wedding to bring gifts for the newly married couple.</p>
  <p class='center'>To make this easier on you, we've prepared 3 options for gifts.</p>
  <ul class='options'>
    <li>
      <h3>Gift</h3>
      <p>
        You can find most of the items we've registered for on 
        <a href=''>our digital registry</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have also created traditional registries at 
        <a href='http://www.heathceramics.com/giftregistry/view/index/id/ecdc255ea30a1d009e6a111360b09124/'>Heath Ceramics</a>,
        <a href='http://www.surlatable.com/registry/giftRegistryList.jsp?id=200901070429'>Sur La Table</a> and 
        <a href='https://www.bloomingdales.com/registry/wedding/guest/?registryId=2155684'>Bloomingdales</a>. 
      </p>
