    <strong>We have reserved</strong> a block of rooms at The Loews of Hollywood so our guests can reserve at a discounted rate. The hotel is located in the heart of Hollywood with a wealth of culture and activities within walking distance. On the night of the event, transportation will be provided to the Ebell. While not necessary, if you do decide to bring a car, please note that parking is either by Valet at $40 per day or self-parked in the Hollywood-Highland complex at $30 per entry with no ins-and-outs.
