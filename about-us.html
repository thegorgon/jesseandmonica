    By coincidence, they ended up on the same flight to Bordeaux. During the flight, Jesse came to Monica's seat to see how she was doing. Monica says she remembers thinking how nice that was.

    The coincidences continued - housed with French families, Monica and Jesse ended up on the same street: Rue Naujac. Their first day in France, Monica and Jesse met up to explore the town and buy phones.

    Monica and Jesse became best friends, spending time together almost every day. While Jesse insisted they were merely friends, his host mother, Joanna, began to hint to him about their relationship.
